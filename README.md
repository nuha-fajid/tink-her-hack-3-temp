### Project Description
QuickDine is a website designed to help users view the various restaurants in the city they prefer, table and parking space availabilities. It also enables them to view the menu of that particular restaurant and book their desired number of tables. Each reservation lasts for only 10 minutes and costs a fixed amount.

### The Problem statement
There are many people who are quite hesitant to go into restaurants with a big crowd and wait to get their tables. At the same time, many look for a good parking spot right infront of the restaurant. QuickDine is a solution for both the problems at once!

### The Solution
We have built a website which allows you to browse all the restaurants nearby the location you prefer and some additional facilities like viewing their menu, booking tables in advance and checking the parking space availability.

## Technical Details

This video basically shows how this website is designed and its working. It starts with a home page, which has search bars for location and particular restaurant separately. By searching the location, various restaurants in the nearby locations are shown along with their star ratings. By clicking the preferred restaurant, we can view the menu card, view the parking space availabilities ( green for free space and red for occupied space ) and make table bookings. We can book based on their seating arrangement also. The booked tables will be shown. On clicking the confirm button, it moves to another page which reviews the ids of the selected tables and requests phone number from user. On pressing confirm, it moves you to the various payment gateways. On completing the payment, a confirmation page and timer is shown. User can move back to the home page if needed.
