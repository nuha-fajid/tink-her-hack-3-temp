### Project Description
QuickDine is a website designed to help users view the various restaurants in the city they prefer, table and parking space availabilities. It also enables them to view the menu of that particular restaurant and book their desired number of tables. Each reservation lasts for only 10 minutes and costs a fixed amount.

### The Problem statement
There are many people who are quite hesitant to go into restaurants with a big crowd and wait to get their tables. At the same time, many look for a good parking spot right infront of the restaurant. QuickDine is a solution for both the problems at once!

### The Solution
We have built a website which allows you to browse all the restaurants nearby the location you prefer and some additional facilities like viewing their menu, booking tables in advance and checking the parking space availability.
